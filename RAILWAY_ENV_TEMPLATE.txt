# ===== NOTES =====
# 1. Add these variables to ALL 4 services: App, Worker, Cron, Bot
# 2. The ${{Service.VARIABLE}} syntax is Railway-specific - it references other services
# 3. Make sure Postgres and Redis services are created BEFORE adding these variables
# 4. Don't commit these values to git - they're sensitive!
# 5. After adding variables, click "Deploy" to restart the service
